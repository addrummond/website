I'm a faculty lecturer in the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/">Linguistics Department</a> at McGill.
My research focuses on the division of labor between the narrow syntax and the interfaces.
So far, I've focused on binding and scope phenomena. In both domains,
I think that the role of the interpretative
interfaces has been somewhat overestimated, and the role of the PF interface underestimated.

I wrote the <a href="http://spellout.net/ibexfarm">Ibex</a>
software for performing certain kinds of behavioral psycholinguistic experiments online.
