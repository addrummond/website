I'm a postdoc in the Department of Philosophy at <a href="http://dur.ac.uk">Durham University</a>,
working on the <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/uncartesianlinguistics/">Un-Cartesian Linguistics</a>
project with <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/?id=4296">Wolfram Hinzen</a>.

My research focuses on the division of labor between the narrow syntax and the interfaces.
So far, I've focused on binding and scope phenomena. In both domains,
I think that the role of the interpretative
interfaces has been somewhat overestimated, and the role of the PF interface underestimated.

I defended my dissertation in July 2011 at <a href="http://ling.umd.edu">UMD</a>. My advisor
was <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/people/person/norbert-hornstein/">Norbert Hornstein</a>.

I wrote the <a href="http://spellout.net/ibexfarm">Ibex</a>
software for performing certain kinds of behavioral psycholinguistic experiments online.
