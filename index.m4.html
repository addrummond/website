I'm a visiting professor in the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/linguist/">Linguistics Department</a> at UMass.
My research focuses on the division of labor between the narrow syntax and the interfaces.
So far, I've focused on binding and scope phenomena. In both domains,
I think that the role of the interpretative
interfaces has been somewhat overestimated, and the role of the PF interface underestimated.
