<h2>Ibex and the Ibex Farm</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/webspr">Ibex</a> (formerly &lsquo;webspr&rsquo;) is a tool
for running behavioral psycholinguistic experiments. It can do ordinary acceptability judgments,
self-paced reading, and speeded acceptability. It's fairly easy to adapt for other things
if you're comfortable with Javascript programming. Ibex itself is basically just a Python CGI
script, and you can set it up on more or less any cheap hosting solution. Most of the time,
it's easier to host your experiment on the <a href="http://spellout.net/ibexfarm">Ibex Farm</a>.

<h2>Numberize</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/addrummond/numberize">Numberize</a> is a Python script for automatically numbering examples and sections in ODT documents. I use it to make writing linguistics papers in google docs less painful. When you're done, you can download your document in ODT format and run the script to automatically number examples and headings. (The google docs export feature is a bit buggy, unfortunately, but the end result is usually pretty good for simple papers.)

<h2>Imask</h2>
<p>
Durham don't provide an email forwarding service or a POP server. This made it a bit
difficult to get my dur.ac.uk email address forwarded to my gmail. Imask provides
an ugly but workable solution to this problem. It repeatedly polls the Durham IMAP
server, and then sets up a POP server for gmail to poll. (Gmail can be set to repeatedly
fetch mail from a POP server, but not an IMAP server.) Imask is a node.js project
available on <a href="https://github.com/addrummond/imask">github</a>.

<h2>RJson</h2>
<p>
This was an experiment with the <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/syb3/">Scrap Your Boilerplate With Class</a>
paradigm in Haskell. The idea was to make serializing and parsing JSON date
more-or-less automatic using data type reflection. In practice, the code
ended up being extremely complex, and (in my opinion) a demonstration
that SYBWC is not so great in practice as it is in theory. I think one
or two people may have tried using it a couple of years ago, but it
doesn't seem to have caught on. The module is still available
on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/RJson-0.3.7">hackage</a>.

<h2>Ant search</h2>
<p>
An attempt to replicate a simulation reported in <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/j148444160k574g1/">this 1981 paper</a>
by R&uuml;diger Wehner and Mandyam Srinivasan. Desert ants perform a search
when they fail to find their nests via their usual navigation methods.
Wehner and Srinivasan argue that the ant's search pattern implements
a near-optimal probabilistic search strategy. Source code is on <a href="https://github.com/addrummond/ants">github</a>.
You can also see the simulation <a href="http://spellout.net/ants/search.html">here</a>
